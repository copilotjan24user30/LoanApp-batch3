1. Two ways to generate  test file
 1. Right click on the   source file  - Source Action - Generate test - Choose method
      it will generate the physical file   
       through the prompt you can generate test cases
        or with the help of chat  you can generate test cases
2. select the source code  - go to chat -  /tests
   
Prompt ?

    instructions and context passed to a language model to achieve a desired task
- composed of following components
  - Instructions (what do you want it to do - explain, create or generate, clarify or classify, convert or compare etc.)
  - Context (topic, opinion, comparison, role) 
  - Input Data (examples)
  - Output Indiactors (in 3 senetence, tabular, json format)
You do not need all the four elements for a prompt and the fomat depends on the task at hand.

quality  prompt   --> quality output (expected output)

__Prompt Engineering__

practice of developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use generative AI models
 -Formulating precise prompts or questions t othese AI models to generate desired responses
 -Crucial role in refining AI interactions, making them more accurate and relevant
 - Enables all kinds of innovative a alications on top of LLMs


 __Skills requied__
-Basic understanding of Generativve AI / ML concepts
-String Communication Skill
  - Adapt at formulating cleara, concise and effective prompts
-Analytical Skills
  - Analyze the responses generatted by the AI and refine the prompts accordingly
  
__Best Practices for Prompt Engineering__
- Start simple
 - An iterative process that requires a lot of experimentation
-Clearly communicate what content or information is most important
-Structure the promt: Start by defining role, give context/input data and then provide the instructions
-Break down the task into simpler subtasks
-Use specific and varied examples to help models narrow its focus
-Use constraints to limit the  scope of models output
-Instruction
 - instruct the model what you want to achieve such as "write", "classify", "summarize", "Translate", "order", etc.
 - Try different instructions with different keywords, contexts, and data and wee what works best for your particular use case and task
-Be Creative

Common Tasks using Prompts
-Text Summarization (you tube)
-Text Classification (tech, sentiment)
-Information Extraction(piece of text/code/json)
-Data Organization(tabular/xml/yml/json)
-Question Answering
-Role Playing
-Code Generation
-Reasoning


Priming
   - setting the context
   Referes to the practice of providing some inital input to the model before generating a response.
 The inital input is intended to guide the model toward generating a response that is more relevant with the user's intended output
 - Topic Specific Priming
 - Opinion Prompting
 - Tone and Style Prompting
   - Tone style prompting can help guide writers to convey their content in a specific manner, whether it's formal, informal, persuasive, informative or creative.
